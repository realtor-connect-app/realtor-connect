### About

### Local startup guide

---
A quick guide to running the program on a local machine.

The following instructions for running the program will be using Docker. So, it is recommended to install it before you
start. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

1. To build the application, you need to install Gradle. [Install Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/).
2. Install Java 17.
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/makurohashami/realtor-connect.git`.
4. To start the database, go to `scripts/samples` and run the script `reset_db_docker.sh`. You can customize the
   variables if you need to.
5. If you want to use MailHog to intercept emails, open `scripts/samples` and run the script `reset_mailhog_docker.sh`.
   You can customize the variables if you need to. [Read more about MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog).
6. Build the project using your IDE or open bash in the project directory and run `gradle clean assemble`.
7. Configure the environment variables. Read the table of the list of variables.

   Some variables have default values. You do not need to set a variable if you are satisfied with the default value.

   | Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Default value           |

Possible values: `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` and `TRACE` | `DEBUG`                 |

8. Launch the application through your IDE or open bash and
   run `java -jar {project_path}/build/libs/realtor-connect-{app_version}.jar`.
9. All done! Now you can use [Application](http://localhost:8080) locally.

### Quick start

---
This section describes the main features of the program, as well as examples of how to use the application. After
reading this section, you will understand how to use the application, perform simple operations, and create your first
real estate object.

#### Main points

- This application is a back end API communication with which goes through the HTTP protocol.
- The visual component of the application is the Swagger UI page, which forms the dynamic documentation of the project.

#### 1. Registration

Let's create a Realtor.

Go to the main page.

![main-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897282/realtor-connect-common/samples/main-page.jpg)

Go to `Auth Controller`, open the `/auth/register/realtor` endpoint and press `Try it out` button.

![realtor-registration-request](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897282/realtor-connect-common/samples/realtor-reg.jpg)

Next fill a request body with next JSON and press `Execute` button:

```json
{
  "name": "Joe Doe",
  "email": "joedoe@mail.com",
  "username": "joedoe",
  "password": "pass",
  "phone": "+380711844542",
  "agency": "Joe Doe Private Realtor",
  "agencySite": "joedoerealtor.com"
}
```

![realtor-registration-request-with-body](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897282/realtor-connect-common/samples/realtor-reg-with-body.jpg)

In response, we get the following result:

![realtor-registration-response](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897282/realtor-connect-common/samples/realtor-reg-response.jpg)

That's great. We just signed up.

But we still can't log in to the app because our email is not verified. We have already received a welcome email. This
example uses MailHog to capture all emails, so let's go to its page (Link for local started
up: [MailHog Page](http://localhost:8025/)).

Here we can see welcome email. Let's open it.

![mail-hog-main-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897283/realtor-connect-common/samples/mail-hog-main.jpg)

Let's press `Confirm Email` button.

![mail-hog-welcome-email](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897283/realtor-connect-common/samples/mail-hog-welcome-email.jpg)

We've redirected on new page with json result. As you can see, success and result is `true`. We just confirmed email,
and now can successfully log in Realtor Connect.

![email-verification-response](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897282/realtor-connect-common/samples/email-verification-response.jpg)

#### 2. Login

Got to the app and go to `Auth Controller`, open the `/auth/login` endpoint and press `Try it out` button. Next put in
request body following JSON and press `Execute` button:

```json
{
  "username": "joedoe",
  "password": "pass"
}
```

![auth-login-endpoint](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897282/realtor-connect-common/samples/auth-login-endpoint.jpg)

Result. We've successfully authenticated.

![auth-login-response](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897282/realtor-connect-common/samples/auth-login-response.jpg)

Let's copy an auth token, go to top of app page, press `Autorize` button, put there auth token and press `Autorize`
button.

![swagger-authorize-window](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhseztjx1/image/upload/v1711897284/realtor-connect-common/samples/swagger-authorize-window.jpg)

```

Response:
